For changing my computer parts. I don't have phtoshop in my computer. That's why can't add original photo's from the psd file.
Sorry for that - i use my own picture. But section 04 where that i add picture and text side by side. I don't that part as responsive it was take more time from me. That's why i avoid that part.
Hope you like the project.
Thanks in advance
